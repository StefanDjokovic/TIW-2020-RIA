# TIW-RIA-Exam
The project tech to use are JavaScript+HTML+CSS front-end and Java Servlet+MySQL backend.
The website to build is a image gallery organized in album. When pressing on an album the first 5 picture miniatures appear, and when hovering on them a modal displays the picture in full-size with its properties. Also sign-up and sign-in have to be supported, and on each picture a user can publish a comment. Other specifications are:
* On Signup checks on validity of email and repeated passwords have to be done also client side
* After the login, the whole application must be a unique page
* Each user interaction must be performed without refreshing the whole page but with asynchronous calls to the server
* Each user has personalized album page ordering. By default it is by date of creation, and then a user can move each album and save the new order. When the user signs in again they should see their last saved order of albums
* The "next 5 pictures" and "previous 5 pictures" must function without any server request
* Hovering on miniatures must display a modal with original size picture, all the other informations, and comments with a submit comment box
* The application checks also client side that the client doesn't send blank comments
* Errors server-side must appear in the client though an alert box
